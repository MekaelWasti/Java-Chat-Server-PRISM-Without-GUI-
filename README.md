# Java-Chat-Server-PRISM-Without-GUI-

Java multithreaded server program made to manage multiple PRISM chat application clients, connecting from any connection on the internet.

The server can be hosted locally (make client socket port and server socket port the same and make client socket address 'localhost') 
or over the internet (by port forwarding public IP of machine running the server and changing the client to the public IP of that machine)

**The server is currently running on an EC2 instance on AWS. You can connect to this server with a socket connection using the public IP: {NEED TO CONFIGURE ELASTIC IP} on port 63030.**
